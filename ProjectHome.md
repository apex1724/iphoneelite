This is the temporary home of the iPhone Elite development team's work.  It was created after Zibri commandeered the first Elite wiki when he was booted from the combined teams.


## No contributions ##
One of the founding principles of Elite from day one was "we don't accept money" (you can see that founding quote still below in the original "About us" paragraph).  It was about fun, not profit.   Zibri is now actively seeking contributions and uses sponsored ads on his blog.  That's how far he's fallen from the Elite team ideals.  (That, and publishing/selling an illegal IMEI changer).

## A NOTE ON THE LEAKED JERRYSIM ##
Zibri's unauthorized release of the Jerrysim code has effectively killed this exploit (actually, this entire _class_ of exploits).  The code leak pointed Apple exactly to what needs to be fixed, and now it will be fixed before the kinks of Jerrysim can be worked out.  So it was a wreckless leak with no practical purpose other than to derail the efforts of a team he was no longer welcome on.  The [community lost](http://www.hackint0sh.org/forum/showthread.php?t=28722) an exploit for no reason other than personal spite.

## A NOTE ON THE LEAKED ANYSIM 1.1.3 ##

Zibri basically just leaked it and changed the credits to his own name.  That's it.  Gray did all of the work, Zibri was not involved at all.  If he had done anything for it, I would be fair and say that he had, but he didn't.  It's no different than if any person from outside the dev team got ahold of a beta copy, and did the same.  He can talk all he wants about the 'crazy ones, misfits, etc.' but all he did was just steal something from someone (Gray), claim it as his own, and release it before it was ready because he was pissed off for being voted out of the team.

There are thousands upon thousands of people that will download and use that piece of software without ever giving so much as  an iota of thought to how hard this one, individual person worked to make this happen for you all free of charge.  So for those of you who say 'bravo for releasing' to Zibri, please be aware that you're also saying 'screw you' to Gray, the guy who actually did all the work.

## OTHER NEWS ##

This page is more of a repository for what was the former 'iphone-elite' team.  All of this info will be migrating to a new site that is the result of the union of the former 'iphone-elite' and 'dev team'.


**About us**: We don't like secrecy, we don't take ourselves too seriously, and we're not out to make money. If you want to help, you can keep us company on IRC (we stay up very late) or send us iPhones (working or not) for testing. Monetary contributions are not accepted. If you have money you want to donate, please donate it to a good charity.

The "iPhone Elite" name started out as a joke when the iPhone Dev Team forked due to some personality issues. Fortunately, these issues are now long past us and the Dev Team and Elite Team are now reunited and working together cooperatively.
