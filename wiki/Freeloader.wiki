= Introduction =

Freeloader is an attempt at writing a reusable and extensible loader framework for the baseband. Think of it as an interactive, low-level debugger for inside the baseband.

= Details =

Freeloader is in the early stages of development. Since we have no documentation for the PMB8876 baseband chip, everything has to be done through RCE and trial and error. That said, everyone is welcome to contribute and share.

= How to Get Freeloader =

Freeloader is available in our Subversion repository.
