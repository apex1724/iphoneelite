#summary How to downgrade the baseband
#labels Tutorial
Normally, the baseband does not allow for downgrading. For each firmware flash, a check is present that ensures that it is an upgraded version or the same version. Luckily there is a way around this for 3.9 bootloader phones.

= Prerequisites =

 # The FLS and EEP file of the firmware you want to flash
 # The secpack of your current firmware (or a newer one)
 # The bbupdater and ieraser tools (don't forget to set the permissions to 755!)
 # MobileTerminal (you lose Wi-Fi access during this process)

Upload all of these to your phone in the /usr/bin folder.

= Instructions =

 # Launch MobileTerminal.
 # Unload CommCenter by typing *launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.CommCenter.plist*.
 # Change folders to the /usr/bin folder by typing *cd /usr/bin*.
 # Erase your baseband by typing *ieraser*.
 # Now reflash the new firmware with bbupdater (this can be any firmware version). Type *bbupdater -f firmware.fls -e firmware.eep*. Replace firmware.fls with the FLS file of the firmware you have - and firmware.eep with the EEP file of the firmware you have.
 # Reboot your phone.

= Unlocking =

If you used anySIM, your iPhone will be relocked and you will need to run anySIM again. If you used IPSF, then your phone should still be unlocked.
